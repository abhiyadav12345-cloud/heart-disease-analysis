Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart’s structure and function, including coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems, and heart failure. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases account for millions of deaths each year, making early detection and prevention extremely important.

One of the most common types of heart disease is coronary artery disease (CAD). It occurs when the blood vessels supplying the heart become narrowed or blocked due to plaque buildup, a condition known as atherosclerosis. This can reduce blood flow to the heart muscle and may lead to chest pain (angina) or heart attack. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and lack of physical activity.

Heart disease can often be prevented through healthy lifestyle choices. Regular exercise, a balanced diet low in saturated fats and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding tobacco significantly reduce the risk. Medical management, including medications and routine health screenings, also plays a vital role in controlling risk factors and preventing complications.

In recent years, data analysis and machine learning techniques have been widely used to predict heart disease at an early stage. By analyzing patient data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate, predictive models can help doctors identify high-risk individuals. This project focuses on analyzing heart disease data to understand key risk factors and improve early diagnosis and treatment strategies.
